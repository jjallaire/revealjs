# revealjs (development version)

- Support TOC page by adding `toc` and `toc_depths` arguments to `revealjs_presentation`, and allowing modify title with the top-level parameter in the YAML frontmatter, `toc-title` (thanks, @cderv, #127). If TOC has too many items, it becomes scrollable (thanks, @atusy, #128).

- `smart` argument has been removed from `revealjs_presentation()` has no more used by **rmarkdown**. `smart = TRUE` is still the default. If you need to deactivate, use `md_extensions = "-smart"`.

- Add `title-slide` id on the auto generated title slide to ease the styling using CSS.

- Support `background-image` pandoc's variable as other slide framework to customize the option `parallaxBackgroundImage`. This duplicates the variable `parallaxBackgroundImage` which still get precedence.

- Fix template to add the necessary CSS to format [columns layout](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#columns) and other Pandoc's features (thanks, @atusy, #82).

- Fix an issue with some configurations keys for chalkboard plugin - multiple value are now correctly passed to Pandoc's template (thanks, @grayknight2, @atusy, #62, #88).

- Fix issues with quoting of options when passed as variables to Pandoc. This was caused by a change in Pandoc 2.14.0.3 which now sets some default value for reveal.js options (thanks, @iain-palmer, #72).

- Add `md_extensions` argument in `revealjs_presentation()` (thanks, @atusy, #75).
